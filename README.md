# UPC-A Barcode Generator

This project is a simple barcode generator using Python. It creates a UPC-A barcode and saves it as an SVG file. The barcode is generated using random numbers for the manufacturer and product codes.

# Prerequisites
To run this code, you need to have Python installed along with the python-barcode package. You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install python-barcode
```

# Code Overview
This script generates a UPC-A barcode and saves it as an SVG file. The barcode consists of an individual number, a manufacturer number, and a product number. Here is a breakdown of the code:

# Import Statements
```bash
import barcode
import random
from barcode.writer import ImageWriter
from barcode.writer import SVGWriter
from barcode import UPCA
from io import BytesIO
```

barcode: A library to generate barcodes in various formats.
random: Pythonâ€™s built-in module to generate random numbers.
ImageWriter: Used for generating barcodes as images.
SVGWriter: Used for generating barcodes as SVG files.
UPCA: Represents the UPC-A barcode format.
BytesIO: Allows the code to work with byte objects in memory, though it is not used in this script.

# Global Variables
```bash
path_svg = './barcodes/generated.svg'
length = 5
numbers = '0123456789'
```

* path_svg: The path where the generated SVG file will be saved.
* length: The length of the random number sequences used for manufacturer and product numbers.
* numbers: A string containing digits from which random numbers will be selected.
* Barcode Number Components

```bash
individual_number = '8'
manufacturer_number = "".join(random.choices(numbers, k=length))
product_number = "".join(random.choices(numbers, k=length))
```

* individual_number: A fixed number used at the start of the barcode.
* manufacturer_number: A random 5-digit number representing the manufacturer.
* product_number: A random 5-digit number representing the product.
  
# Function: generate_svg()
```bash
def generate_svg():
    code_template = str(individual_number + str(manufacturer_number) + str(product_number))

    with open(path_svg, "wb") as f:
        code = UPCA(code_template, writer=SVGWriter())
        code.write(f)

    print(f'Generated code: {code}')
    print(f'The SVG code was generated in: {path_svg}')
```

* code_template: Concatenates the individual, manufacturer, and product numbers to form a 12-digit string, which is used as the content for the UPC-A barcode.
* open(path_svg, "wb"): Opens a file in binary write mode to save the SVG barcode.
* UPCA(): Creates a UPC-A barcode object using the code_template.
* code.write(f): Writes the barcode in SVG format to the specified file.
* print statements: Outputs the generated barcode information and file path to the console.

# Usage
To generate a new UPC-A barcode as an SVG file, run the script in a Python environment:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

This will generate a barcode and save it in the specified path (./barcodes/generated.svg).

# Customization
You can customize the generated barcode by modifying the individual_number, length, or the path_svg variable.

individual_number: Change this value to alter the starting number of the barcode.
length: Modify this to change the length of the manufacturer and product numbers.
path_svg: Change the file path to save the barcode in a different location or with a different name.
